# Project 1: Image Resizer

This project is an image resizer tool developed by Krishna01work. It allows you to resize images to a specified width and height.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pillow (Python Imaging Library)

## Description

The Image Resizer tool is a command-line application built using Python and the Pillow library. It provides a convenient way to resize images to a desired width and height.

To use the Image Resizer, follow these steps:

1. Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org)

2. Install Pillow Library: The Image Resizer tool relies on the Pillow library for image processing. You can install it using the following command:

       pip install pillow

3. Clone the Repository: Clone the Python-projects repository to your local machine using the following command:

       git clone https://github.com/Krishna01work/Python-projects.git

4. Navigate to the Image Resizer directory:

       cd Python-projects/image resizer


5. Run the Image Resizer: Execute the following command to run the Image Resizer tool:


Replace `path/to/input/image.jpg` with the path to your input image file, `path/to/output/resized_image.jpg` with the desired path for the resized image file, `desired_width` with the desired width in pixels, and `desired_height` with the desired height in pixels.

For example, to resize an image named "input_image.jpg" to a width of 800 pixels and a height of 600 pixels and save it as "resized_image.jpg", you would run the following command:


6. The Image Resizer will process the input image, resize it to the specified dimensions, and save the resized image at the specified output path.

Feel free to experiment with different image files and dimensions using the Image Resizer tool.

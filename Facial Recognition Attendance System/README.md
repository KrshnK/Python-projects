# Facial Recognition Attendance System

This project is a Facial Recognition Attendance System developed by Krishna01work.

## Description

The Facial Recognition Attendance System is a Python application that utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize faces and track attendance. The system uses a pre-trained deep learning model to detect and recognize faces in real-time using a webcam or pre-recorded videos.

The key features of this project include:

- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Attendance tracking and management
- Support for multiple users and databases

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and libraries are used in this project:

- Python
- OpenCV
- dlib
- face_recognition
- numpy

## Usage

To use the Facial Recognition Attendance application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

        git clone https://github.com/Krishna01work/Python-projects.git

2. Navigate to the "" project directory:

        cd Python-projects/Facial\ Recognition\ Attendance\ System
3. Install the required dependencies:

       pip install face-recognition
       pip install opencv-python
       pip install numpy
       pip install cmake
5. Run the `facial_recogn.py` file:
       
        python facial_recogn.py

6. Follow the instructions on the command-line interface.

# Robo Speaker

This is a Python project in the Python-projects repository created by Krishna01work.

## Description

The Robo Speaker project is a text-to-speech application that converts written text into spoken words.

The application provides a simple and intuitive command-line interface where users can enter the text they want to convert into speech. Once the text is provided, the program generates an audio file in the form of an MP3 file and plays it back using the default media player on the system.

This project is an excellent example of using text-to-speech capabilities in Python and can be a starting point for further customization or integration into other applications.
